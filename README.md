# Mini CI/CD Demo

This project demonstrates a production-style CI/CD pipeline with:

- Multi-stage GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated security scanning
- Automated deployment to AWS EC2
- Demo Node.js application (Express)

## Demo App
- `/` → Web UI
- `/health` → Health check endpoint

## Pipeline Stages
1. Build
2. Test
3. Security Scan
4. Deploy

This project is intentionally small to focus on CI/CD, security, and deployment best practices.
